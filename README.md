### 🛠️ Languages and Tools 🛠️
I started my programming journey from printing "Hello World!" using C programming language and then picked up Python by working on Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP projects. I gained a lot of experience and also learnt some of the amazing languages and tools used in the world.
