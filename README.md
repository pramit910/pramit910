### 🛠️ Languages and Tools 🛠️
I started my programming journey from printing "Hello World!" using C programming language and then picked up Python along with other tools and technologies like SQL, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Docker, etc by working on Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP projects. With all of this, I've gained a lot of experience and also learnt some of the amazing languages and tools used in the world.
